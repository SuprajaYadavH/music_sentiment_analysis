Oh!
I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one that's pure inside
Everyday, every way, I smell of suicide
Bitter sins, how they grow within, so you tell me it ain't right
I am all sin and you're my reason for life

[Chorus]
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
[Verse 2]
I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one who's broken from giving
Everyday, every way, I swear just one last try
Killin' me with the death to be, something that's so right
I am all sin, my hands are scarred with time

[Chorus]
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo

[Post-Chorus]
Stop, look at me!
Look through my eyes

[Bridge]
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand

Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding

Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight

'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin

No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

There's a place in the shadows
Deep inside me where hatred grows
And if you would just let go
I would show you what lies below

I'll never be like them
They'll always call us strange
Their hypocritic ways
Are driving me insane
I'd rather end it all
Than have to live this way
Just let me be myself
Or stay out of my way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stay out of my way

Shaking with anger
There's no forgiveness
It's never-ending
I'm so fucking sick of this

[Verse 2]
Say goodbye to the judgment
And just let go of all you know
You belong on the outside
They will hate what they can't control

They think they're so perfect
Looking down on the strange
Sitting upon their thrones
I'll take it all away

I felt a hate again
Erupting out of me
I want to make them pay
And feel my agony

Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star

Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

You are higher in the sky

[Verse 3]
Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild

When you get to the other side, please, send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn

Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
And long-lived what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore, anymore

[Chorus 1]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
[Verse 2]
I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that
Step outta line and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all-day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday

[Chorus 2]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch

[Bridge]
Blinded by your sacred faded past times, only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance
To prove that your arrogance is stronger than you'll ever be
It's stronger than you can be

Oh, stronger than you can be
Oh, stronger than you can
Be

Now that you’re hooked, it’s all becoming clear

You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face

Can you feel that?
Ah, shit

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

[Verse 1]
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes, violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

[Verse 2]
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me
You might also like[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

[Bridge]
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream!

[Interlude]
No, Mommy, don't do it again!
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, I promise!
No, Mommy, don't hit me!
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die!
[Hook]
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness

Open up your hate and let it flow into me

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgment Day, the Second Coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die

[Verse 1]
Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
Never-ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality
[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

[Verse 2]
Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with young incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Sustained by immoral observance, a domineering deity

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath

[Chorus]
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
A never-ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity
