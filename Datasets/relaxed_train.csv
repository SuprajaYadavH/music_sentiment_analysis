[00:14.12]Oh the crystal caves
[00:16.31]
[00:16.87]We shed both our jackets
[00:19.35]And I hammered brackets

[01:01.04]So we spent the day submerged
[01:06.53]

[01:46.29]We swim hand and hand
[01:48.17]Over white satin sand
[01:50.98]And you left a ribbon
[01:53.04]To honor the pale gibbon moon
[01:57.12]
[01:59.62]But that was years ago
[02:05.01]
[02:07.29]And we never came up for air
[02:12.05]Down there
[02:17.23]We can go anywhere
[02:20.73]
[02:23.98]The old world was dying
[02:26.11]While we took our flying
[02:28.48]Like peregrine falcons
[02:30.98]Beneath the transparent blue waves
[02:35.29]
[02:37.55]Far below the surf
[02:40.12]
[02:40.43]And we spent the hours
[02:42.61]With submarine flowers
[02:45.12]I knew I'd remember
[02:47.24]That day in November
[02:49.62]As we
[02:54.10]Felt alive again

[02:56.68]Cuz we found ourselves in the sea
