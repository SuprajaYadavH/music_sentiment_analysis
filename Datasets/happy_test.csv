[00:12.44]Get my kids up make breakfast

[00:17.25]
[00:17.87]And as i sit down i look up
[00:20.42]And your standing in the doorway sun at your back
[00:23.07]In my old brown dressing gown
[00:25.68]Well no one can love you more than i love you now, but i
[00:28.68]
[00:29.17]Gotta go running for the bus

[00:34.72]But the drivers waiting and that’s strange
[00:37.79]Kids on the top deck quiet for a change
[00:40.73]And there’s no rain and no roadworks
[00:43.46]In the bus lane and all my hurts run away
[00:49.05]And im smiling as i’m punching in

[01:23.96]Saying Rob the gob is getting kicked out
[01:26.93]For embezzling funds from the company account
[01:29.59]And id be lying if i said i wasn’t chuffed
[01:32.74]Cos i always hated rob
[01:34.97]And now they’ll probably offer me robs old job
[01:38.09]
[01:38.52]And in the park at lunch
[01:39.71]There’s no whinos on my favorite bench
[01:41.86]None of that drunk chatter none of that pissy stench
[01:44.74]And the scrawny little pigeons with the gammy legs
[01:47.68]Decide to dive bomb from someone else’s sandwich instead
[01:50.56]And there’s something about the city today
[01:52.96]Like all the colors conspire to overwhelm the grey
[01:55.64]And this close to the fire i can feel no cold
[01:58.64]Put a rainbow halo around my soul

[02:02.14]The day i died was the best day of my life

[02:28.49]Should i wait for another no i cant be arsed
[02:32.00]I begin to walk
[02:33.23]And rush hour crowd seem to part like the red sea
[02:37.24]And i’m stopping at the offy
[02:38.60]20 cigarettes and a 6 pack to relax me
[02:42.54]And as i cross back over the street
[02:45.08]I guess i never saw that taxi
