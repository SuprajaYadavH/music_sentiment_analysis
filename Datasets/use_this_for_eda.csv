Even a well lit place, can hide salvation
A map to a one man maze that never sees the sun
Where the lost are the heroes
And the thieves are left to drown
But everyone knows by now
Fairy-tales are not found
They are written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)
It has begun

Into the dark below
Evading shadows
Blind in a rabbit's hole
We fall beneath the earth
And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls

You're my best friend, I need you around""
I said ""I'm sorry but I don't see no way out""

Suddenly all the words poured out
Like for a year now, I've been faking
All these voices, they scream so loud
And whеn those days come around
Wherе the demons come out, I can deal with 'em now
Because I've been through hell
And I found my way out

I could never say we could go back and be how it used to
But every time I think back to late summer in July, I still miss you
And now our families don't even say a word
I used to come over every Friday after work
But that was before all the pain you caused me
And all the lies you told, it's haunting

[Chorus]
I still see your face when I go to sleep
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent but now I know
(I know, I know)
I know how hard it is to move on with my life
When all of thеse daydreams come back to mе at night
I hate that it'll take time to forget this, but now I know
It's better to love you from a distance
To love you from a distance
[Verse 2]
Remember when I'd drive you home, 'cause you didn't have your license
We were windows down cruising thinking, ""Damn I really like him""
And then I went out and got a new car
So it didn't break down when we would drive too far
But that was before all the rain starting falling
And summer turned into autumn

[Chorus]
I still see your face when I go to sleep
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent but now I know

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Wondering if you were ever coming around

I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—

See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character

Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy

She said, ""You're dancing in the movies""

Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

There you go, saving me from out of the cold

But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms

And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction

You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?

[Verse 2]
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

[Chorus]
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""

Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark

In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

I was June, and you wеre my Johnny Cash
Never onе without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

And we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world

Came swingin' like a fist inside a battin' cage
I went swimmin' with the Devil at the bottom of a lake
And he left me there by my lonesome
He was tall and mean with venom eyes so green
Wanted reconciliation, but my tongue was in my teeth
I couldn't find the floor, so I was kickin' with my feet
But they weren't there, they were stolen

I met a sailor on a ship with promise in his eyes
He kissed me on the mouth and dug his fingers in my thighs
But a sailor ain't a savior 'cause they only tell you lies
So I left him there 'til the sunrise
Well, the waves were tall and they were crashin' down
He's layin' in the water, begging God to let him drown
So I showed him all my teeth and then I laughed out loud
'Cause I never wanted savin', I just wanted to be found

Sick thoughts

[Verse 1]
We might just be unkind
But that's just how we're designed
You got me so fucked up
Think about you most of the time
Then I think about losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna stop before we're caught
But don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
And I got things that I want
But you're on top, on top, on top
We're psychos forever in diamonds and leather
We'll never get better, yeah
[Chorus]
That's why I got these
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts
Look what you've caused
You've got 'em too

[Verse 2]
Wanna know what's makin' you numb
Beautiful when the damage is done
You know me, I won't budge
I'm about to start taking what's mine
Then I'll think about losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna stop before we're caught
But don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
And I got things that I want
But you're on top, on top, on top
We're psychos forever in diamonds and leather
We'll never surrender

Feel you runnin' on my mind, creepin' up and down my spine

Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights at stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

And I've been thinkin'
If I move out this year, I'll feel my parents slippin'
Away and also, I'm just scared of that commitment
I really think sometimes there's somethin' that I'm missin', mm

Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult
[Verse 2]
To name this feelin'
Would take a hundred thousand years, some kind of grievin'
But over what I never had, so I've been speakin'
To my therapist, I call her every weekend, mm
I meant to tell you
How I've hated how we left things when it fell through
'Cause you were everythin' to me, where did you run to?
Was it somethin' that I said that colored you blue? Mm

Oh, I know

'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence

Girl, I hate thinking about you
I always dream about you
I know I'm not the same
Fuck, I can't be me without you
It's fucked up, just fake love
You played me, you played us
You caved in, I gave up
You played games then straight front
You straight lied to my face
But it's alright, mess with my mind
So long as I stay, this girl is insane
I left but couldn't escape
I saw through your twisted ways
I ran fast, didn't look back
But tell the world I'm to blame, now

This is my masterpiece, a tragedy, I wrote it myself

But the perfect part about it is it's all that I've got
I'm over wasting time in life trying to be something I'm not

Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack

But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for

Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the marquee
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark, see?
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels
So come, all you wicked, to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so, baby, don't tempt me
I'm knocking on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet
So put your hats on; Lohner, don't get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off
[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
The fame is your best friend, you love it, no questions
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an ax 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you

[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Had to make a choice, either her or my dreams
And I fell in love on the road, but that was a long time ago
I fell for the wrong girl, the type to start a fire
And leave you there to burn
And I found a way to stay alive
But somethin' in me that day died

Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?

If you wanna ride in a fast car

If you get up in the hillside
If you ride out on the planes
If you go digging up dirt
If you go out dancing in the rain
If you go chasing them rainbows
Just to find the gold ain't there

Rain
Coming home again
Stepping off the train
How you been?
I can't complain
It's been a while
I'm glad you came
Coffee in a flask
Driving much too fast
Have you had a drink?
Wouldn't want to ask
Don't wanna think
About the past
[Chorus]
This could be the time we work things out
Say some things that we should say out loud
But if there's anything that I've learnt by now
It'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
It'll be just another thing that we don't talk about

[Verse 2]
Eyes upon the road
The chili's on the stove
Shall we have a beer?
Should I tell a joke?
And keep this sinking ship afloat
And stumble up to bed
But now I'm seeing red
It's not what you did
It's not what you said
It's the silence we choose instead

[Chorus]
This could be thе time we worked things out
Wе could say some things that we should say out loud

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

Knock knock, let the devil in, malevolent

Screaming, ""L-l-l-let us in""

Liquid Tylenol, gelatin, think my skeleton's melting
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Element glue, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerance and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, metal in
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish

How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor in the, motel then

If changing my clothes would make you like me more
If changing my hair would make you care
Then I'd grab the kitchen scissors

If being less insane would make you stay

Say, ""Thank you Ma'am and Mister""

Why am I still here and waiting for us to happen cause you'd never want it
Everything I loved about you I probably imagined
'Cause you never had it

""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist

I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
You can hold my hand if no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back and I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse and it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean, oh
All my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh
[Chorus]
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

[Verse 2]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I've found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it

[Chorus]
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you

Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

I wait for the morning tide, the oceans to rise
But I lay here broken, too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck
So I tell myself this lie, I'm not scared to die
Make mole hills of mountains, there's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
So I leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self sabotage, all of our other scars don't compare

Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath, the hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me

[Verse 2]
There's nothing to fill this void
Start turning into sorrows
So I lay here soaking the sand in my bed
What a day to regret

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder

To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away

These cigarettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's been happenin', what's been on your mind
Lately, you've been searchin' for a darker place to hide
That's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Smacking Chun-Li's ass guess we both know kung fu
Choji getting fatter everyday like a balloon

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1: Bastille]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus: Bastille]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2: Bastille]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Ayo
[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
You might also like[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh

Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone

Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about

She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise

I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)

'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move

[Intro]
One time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now

Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (That's all I need)
All I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

I woulda crossed the stars
To keep you in my life

And do you need someone to help you?
Tell you what to do with it?

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Never felt alone till the late night
Never knew she was my home till the tears dried
Workin' on the karma, but it takes time
Innocence and sadness was a fine line
Better savour every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Maybe someday you'll be happy for me, oh, I
Every minute, boy, steady rhythm joy

The reason I stay
Wеll, I need you today
Baby, I would bleed in your name
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to bе

I woulda waited for you all night to talk for a minute
I'll sing into the cold dark night till you listen
People spend their life heads down, souls hidden
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be, well

[Verse 2]
Never felt alone till the late night
Never knew she was my home till the king cried
Lost inside the forest, but it feels fine
Innocence and sadness in the same night
All the love that just got stolen from your wide eyes
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Let your tears erode my shoulder like a cliff side
Heavy minutes, boy, steady rhythm joy

Well, I need you today

You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my home, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause

But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?

You just went too far
Wrecked your car, called me cryin' in the dark
Now you're breakin' my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face

Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron

Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning

We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen

And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers

Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

And now I'm just another dreamer that LA tore apart

Wave a white flag before you lost

How do you get out of your head?
Telling yourself you won't make it
And second nature is to second guess, or when you
Burn every bridge before you cross
Wave a white flag before you lost
How do you not self-sabotage?

Trying to give myself some grace
Been living with myself full time and
I'm finally trying to see things face to face now

I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine

I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

His ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
He goin' to jail, it’s inevitable, forreal

[Verse 1]
I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldn’t afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down
Turn the lights off in the bathroom
Screaming, ""Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary"" now
Havin’ nightmares about Candyman
With the tool on me like a handyman
Killed my lil' cousin, I’m like, ""Damn it, man""
Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out
With the white sheet, he was laid out
Wanna ask 'Ye, ""Is this a choice?""
It was like this when I came out
What the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
I know niggas that's never gon’ make it out
This that shit you won't see in the media
Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, ""Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up""
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no
[Interlude]
I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, ""Meek, you a menace to society""
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh

[Verse 1: Jade]
In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like

Every time we'd go dancing, I'd see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, pushed my keys too many times
Anyway, he'd start actin' up, and I'd be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks when I heard this melody
And it went like

I'm back, nigga, wassup? ""Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the Devil, is it true?"" Nigga, shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love, so if you get bashed then that's tough luck
FV doin' shit so big, haters, I'm on your side now, nigga, fuck us! It's Knock Madness
Yeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga but I rap with vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack can fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect
I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me dome
They all yellin', ""Hopsin, you turn me on""
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me, woah
And I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me home
Nigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)
See, I got a crew (Crew), but I feel solo
I cruise (Cruise), but the wheels don't roll (Woah)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Uh?) Shit, neither do I (Nah)
I'mma give you niggas one more album then after that
It's peace out, man, I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?
[Chorus]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)

Hopsin is doomed, locked in a room, spaced out like a little pop of the shrooms
God lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news? I made a million bucks but did not get abused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should've never went and dropped outta school
""It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!""
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror (Shit! Fuck! Fuck!)
I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go to pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like ""Ugh...""
I put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby-Doo (-By Doo)
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't kill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man, I don't even know who I are no more

[Verse 3]
Man, y'all niggas tryin' to kill my vibe, lately don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy blowin' up, tryin' to steal my shine, I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But, ""Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'! The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that, I'll buy!""
Well, I got news for you, my screws are loose, I'll tell ya
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to Australia
When I go ghost, I'mma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' ""YOLO"" on a couch, feelin' so dope
Livin' low pro so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like ""hell yeah""
Man, I'm losin' my mind, but y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cares so I use the beats
To talk to so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?

She leaves and I linger
She's killing me with desire for someone else
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die
Oh, these girls that make me wanna die

They're all online

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Blurred nights but we still takin' care we rep the FAM
Wake up way too early get some and food and dine and dash
Too hungover to know the difference between this and that
Focused on how to open her up but approach her with class
Weekends lose their meaning, every evening like the last

You were like a light I didn't know that I needed
You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold
It wasn't long till we both caught feelings
I didn't know that we both had demons, but
It's funny how time reveals it all

And my friends say they saw you with him
At that bar where we met while I'm here in our bed
Do you even regret what you did?

Made me feel like a fool for believin'
You reach for my hand as I turn to leave
But you keep on holdin' on

And you turned around and said ""This isn't fair
It was only one night, there were no feelings shared""

We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch
We joked as we looked that they were too good for us
'Cause socially speaking, we were the same
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank
A tale old as time, young love don't last for life
And now I know, now I know
It's time to go, it's time to go

We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars

From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you
But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew
I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love
You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us
The only mistake that we didn't make was run
(Now look what we've done)

We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars

They got me locked in Spofford, the lil juvenile criminal
Two kids approach to put blades to my throat
They like my coat and ask me what I'm gonna do for that
Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that
So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids, that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said
""Why it gotta be like that?""
'Cause you get a little ox, and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props, and I'm runnin shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil nigga have to get, ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggas wanna put me to the test
So I wild, with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass tec, and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't, got a knuckle game that's a damn shame
Nigga I feel for, they got you washin drawers
But I refuse, 'cause I got nuttin to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford

To Spofford, and JV's worse than Rikers
Adolescents that ball hardcore
With the criminal minded juveniles
The real lil niggas step out of the piles
And I'm not takin no shorts while I'm up here
Spit em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus, catchin beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin out kid
But not too buckwild, cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times, for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here, it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buckwild dorm E section
They got me smokin the death sticks
Niggas got me fightin for my life, cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man got locked down
You want a buck sixty, you betta betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga I wish you would
Try to take mines, and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin me
Even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh
I'm puttin hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin same
I couldn't bitch up when I got here
Cell wreck, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin Uptown
To the big pen, and I'ma still win
'Cause jail is my life, and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.'s think they're five-oh's with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back

I'm really on the ropes this time
I've been fighting all my life for you
I never should've said goodbye
But maybe that's what stupid people do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you gave me peace
And I wasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again
Asking for nothing

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Don't think I could forgive myself
I'm sorry for the ways that I used you
And I could care less right now
But you know, you hurt me pretty good too

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we made each other bleed
And we tasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, love, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Oh, thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh

I want to go back
Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me

Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm
Afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years

[00:34.80]or discriminated against?
[00:36.59]I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against.
[00:39.80]Picket signs for my wicked rhymes.
[00:41.95]Look at the times. Sick is the mind
[00:43.86]of the motha fuckin' kid that's behind
[00:46.13]all this commotion. Emotions run deep
[00:48.12]as ocean's explodin.'
[00:49.55]Tempers flaring from parents,
[00:51.05]just blow 'em off and keep goin.'
[00:52.58]Not takin' nothin' from no one,
[00:54.04]give 'em hell long as I'm breathin.
[00:55.74]Keep kickin' ass in the mornin,'
[00:57.27]an' takin' names in the evening.
[00:59.02]Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth.
[01:02.17]See, they can trigger me
[01:03.60]but they never figure me out.
[01:05.24]Look at me now,
[01:06.69]I bet ya probably sick of me now.
[01:08.68]Ain't you mama,
[01:09.65]I'ma make you look so ridiculous now.
[01:11.88]I'm sorry, Mama.
[01:14.95]I never meant to hurt you.
[01:18.16]I never meant to make you cry, but tonight

[01:31.15]I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
[01:34.23]I'm cleanin' out my closet.
[01:36.29]
[01:38.12]I got some skeletons in my closet
[01:39.74]and I don't know if no one knows it.
[01:41.47]So before they thrown
[01:42.54]me inside my coffin and close it,
[01:44.27]I'ma expose it. I'll take you back to
[01:46.48]73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD.
[01:50.89]I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months.
[01:54.00]My faggot father must have
[01:55.60]had his panties up in a bunch,
[01:57.34]cuz he split.
[01:58.26]I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye.
[02:00.45]No, I don't on second thought,
[02:02.07]I just fuckin' wished he would die.
[02:03.85]I look at Hailie
[02:04.75]and I couldn't picture leavin' her side.
[02:06.98]Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
[02:10.32]to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake.
[02:12.42]I maybe made some mistakes
[02:13.78]but I'm only human.
[02:15.00]But I'm man enough to face them today.
[02:17.67]/What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
[02:20.05]but the smartest shit
[02:21.00]I did was take them bullets out of that gun.
[02:23.20]Cuz id'a killed 'em,
[02:24.46] shit I would have shot Kim an' him both.
[02:26.46]It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show.
[02:29.93]I'm sorry, Mama.
[02:32.56]I never meant to hurt you.

[02:58.93]Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin,'
[03:01.99] But put yourself in my position.
[03:03.93] ust try to envision witnessin' your
[03:06.20]Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen,
[03:08.81]bitchin' that someone's always g
[03:10.04]oin' throuh her purse and shits missin.' Going through
[03:12.27] public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome.
[03:15.47]My whole life I was made to believe
[03:17.06]I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up,
[03:19.07] now I blew up. It makes you sick to ya stomach,
[03:21.63]doesn't it?
[03:22.39]Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
[03:24.87]So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
[03:28.04]But guess what,
[03:29.10]yer gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely.
[03:31.63]An' Nathan's getting' up so quick,
[03:33.13]he's gonna know that your phoney.
[03:34.60]And Hailie's getting' so big now,
[03:36.71]you should see her, she's beautiful.
[03:38.10]But you'll never see her,
[03:39.22]she won't even be at your funeral.
[03:41.27]See what hurts me the most is you won't
[03:43.27]admit you was wrong. Bitch, do ya song.
[03:45.34]Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom.
[03:47.65]But how dare you
[03:48.61]try to take what you didn't help me to get.
[03:50.65]You selfish bitch,
[03:51.94]I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit.
[03:54.09] Remember when
[03:54.96]Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
[03:57.22]Well, guess what, I am dead.
[03:59.04] Dead to you as can be.
[04:00.63]I'm sorry, Mama.

[01:05.00]Where are you now, you gotta let me know

[01:20.00]I can hear your voice
[01:24.00]The ring of yesterday
[01:28.00]It seems so close to me
[01:31.00]But yet so far away
[01:35.00]I should let it out
[01:39.00]To save what's left of me
[01:43.00]And close the doors of doubt
[01:47.00]Revive my dignity
[01:50.00]

[00:09.94]Around 20 past 6
[00:12.44]Get my kids up make breakfast
[00:14.61]1 egg 2 toast 3 weetabix
[00:17.25]
[00:17.87]And as i sit down i look up
[00:20.42]And your standing in the doorway sun at your back
[00:23.07]In my old brown dressing gown
[00:25.68]Well no one can love you more than i love you now, but i
[00:28.68]
[00:29.17]Gotta go running for the bus
[00:31.92]Coat flying and i try not to miss it this time
[00:34.72]But the drivers waiting and that’s strange
[00:37.79]Kids on the top deck quiet for a change
[00:40.73]And there’s no rain and no roadworks
[00:43.46]In the bus lane and all my hurts run away
[00:49.05]And im smiling as i’m punching in
[00:51.63]
[00:52.67]The day i died was the best day of my life
[00:58.67]The day i died was the best day of my life
[01:04.31]Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
[01:06.86]Everything will be alright
[01:10.29]The day i died was the best day of my life
[01:13.94]
[01:15.71]Now the secretaries they got a smile for me
[01:18.03]And the in-tray on my desks almost empty
[01:21.24]I get a memo from executive joe
[01:23.96]Saying Rob the gob is getting kicked out
[01:26.93]For embezzling funds from the company account
[01:29.59]And id be lying if i said i wasn’t chuffed
[01:32.74]Cos i always hated rob
[01:34.97]And now they’ll probably offer me robs old job
[01:38.09]
[01:38.52]And in the park at lunch
[01:39.71]There’s no whinos on my favorite bench
[01:41.86]None of that drunk chatter none of that pissy stench
[01:44.74]And the scrawny little pigeons with the gammy legs
[01:47.68]Decide to dive bomb from someone else’s sandwich instead
[01:50.56]And there’s something about the city today
[01:52.96]Like all the colors conspire to overwhelm the grey
[01:55.64]And this close to the fire i can feel no cold
[01:58.64]Put a rainbow halo around my soul
[02:01.43]
[02:02.14]The day i died was the best day of my life
[02:08.10]The day i died was the best day of my life
[02:13.91]Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
[02:16.17]Everything will be alright
[02:19.68]The day i died was the best day of my life
[02:23.10]
[02:24.67]So i leave work get to the high street and i miss my bus
[02:28.49]Should i wait for another no i cant be arsed
[02:32.00]I begin to walk
[02:33.23]And rush hour crowd seem to part like the red sea
[02:37.24]And i’m stopping at the offy
[02:38.60]20 cigarettes and a 6 pack to relax me
[02:42.54]And as i cross back over the street
[02:45.08]I guess i never saw that taxi
[02:47.08]
[03:11.72]The day i died was the best day of my life
[03:17.54]The day i died was the best day of my life
[03:23.30]Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
[03:25.61]Everything will be alright

[00:26.65]Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
[00:30.87]staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

[00:43.59]Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
[00:47.91]Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
[00:52.68]You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
[01:00.70]Running into the dark underground

[03:48.91]So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
[03:51.81]I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
[03:54.94]Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
[03:58.29]You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
[04:01.00]about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
[04:03.89]but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
[04:06.92]That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
[04:09.77]Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
[04:13.16]and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
[04:15.97]I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
[04:18.86]I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
[04:22.27]You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
[04:25.39]And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
[04:28.28]I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim
[04:32.30]Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
[04:34.10]Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
[04:36.58]but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up,
[04:38.95]see I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
[04:43.35]Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
[04:46.09]Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?

[05:24.88]Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
[05:28.03]You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
[05:30.94]Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
[05:33.75]and here's an autograph for your brother,
[05:35.53]I wrote it on the Starter cap
[05:37.16]I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
[05:40.42]Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
[05:43.26]But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
[05:46.31]I say that shit just clownin dogg,
[05:47.90]c'mon - how fucked up is you?
[05:49.33]You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
[05:52.00]to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
[05:55.17]And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
[05:57.95]That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
[06:01.23]I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
[06:04.01]or maybe you just need to treat her better
[06:06.19]I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself,
[06:10.89]I think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
[06:15.75]why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
[06:19.45]I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
[06:21.55]I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
[06:25.04]Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
[06:27.71]and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
[06:30.74]and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

[01:04.72]He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
[01:07.61]Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
[01:10.75]Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
[01:13.63]Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
[01:16.65]Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet Rams
[01:19.59]I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[01:56.61]My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
[01:59.82]I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around

[02:08.90]The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
[02:12.24]I must be buggin' the f-ck out, but what the f-ck about?
[02:15.03]Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
[02:18.10]They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
[02:21.15]Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
[02:24.30]I pick it and open it but it’s stuffed full of human parts
[02:27.38]I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts

[03:31.79]then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
[03:34.40]with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her

[03:40.50]Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
[03:43.81]I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
[03:46.76]So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
[03:49.76]Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her

[00:13.55]We all fall down like toy soldiers
[00:21.02]Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
[00:25.34]But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
[00:32.47]
[00:32.35]I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
[00:35.32]Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
[00:38.20]I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
[00:41.15]Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
[00:44.12]I'd never drag them in battles
[00:46.05]that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
[00:48.43]I'm supposed to set an example
[00:50.01]I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
[00:52.99]If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
[00:55.98]Now Ja said ""I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it""
[00:58.94]There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
[01:01.96]I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
[01:04.76]It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
[01:07.83]And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
[01:10.60]I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
[01:13.47]And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
[01:16.34]This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
[01:19.55]That was never my object for someone to get killed
[01:22.31]Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
[01:25.08]It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
[01:28.06]I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' (?)
[01:30.74]Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
[01:39.81]So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
[01:42.86]While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
[01:46.89]Like fuck it i understand this is business
[01:49.45]And this shit just isn't none of my business
[01:51.61]But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz
[01:54.70]Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
[01:58.93]We all fall down like toy soldiers
[02:06.30]Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
[02:10.69]But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
[02:17.59]
[02:18.24]There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
[02:20.95]And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
[02:23.86]But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
[02:26.85]The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
[02:29.99]It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
[02:32.82]We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
[02:35.68]Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
[02:38.56]And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
[02:41.62]Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
[02:44.57]Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
[02:47.41]Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
[02:50.27]Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
[02:52.71]Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
[02:56.31]Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
[02:59.14]But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
[03:02.09]Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
[03:05.08]Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
[03:07.97]Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
[03:11.10]But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
[03:13.71]That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
[03:16.53]And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
[03:20.53]We still have soldiers that's on the front line
[03:22.60]That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
[03:25.56]Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
[03:28.54]We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
[03:31.29]To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
[03:34.16]To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners
[03:37.30]Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
[03:40.11]But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
[03:43.08]There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
[03:45.93]Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
[03:48.93]I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
[03:52.03]But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
[03:54.84]I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
[03:56.65]If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
[03:57.87]Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
[04:00.51]I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
