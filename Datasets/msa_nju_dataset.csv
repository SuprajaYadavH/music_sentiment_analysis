[00:53.47] Because there’s nothing worse than somebody pretending away
[00:57.34]The years of their youth they will never get back
[01:00.46]So I'll go home and practice the traits you said I lacked
[01:03.94]Like listening to the thunder of your heart
[01:07.55]And how with every other beat we grew further apart
[01:11.35]Love is always going to be hard to you both
[01:14.62]Never thinking that you'll ever love anyone else as much
[01:18.10]But it’s ugly, it’s ugly now yeah I know
[01:21.84]But you never give things enough time to grow
[01:24.95]It's like driving through a carnival
[01:28.85]It doesn't always have to be beautiful
[01:33.83]Unless its beautiful
[01:37.39]
[01:39.09]Baby I know it's over
[01:41.74]Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
[01:45.17]Now we know it’s true
[01:48.81]The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you
[01:52.09]Baby I know it's over
[01:55.23]Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
[01:58.90]Now we know it’s true
[02:02.20]The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you
[02:06.75]
[02:09.35]So let me tell you tell you a thing or two
[02:12.89]About how to survive when there is a me and a you
[02:16.58]It's awful, it's gruesome, it's something, it's cruel
[02:20.22]Forever you will ask God if this happened to you
[02:23.38]‘Cause I'm always thinking, thinking about where you are
[02:27.50]Who you're with and if your mind is far
[02:30.35]From what we do when we're alone
[02:36.05]Love is to much for me and now the wall needs to grow
[02:40.97]
[02:52.71]So when your head stuck in a tightening vise
[02:56.41]Your ears are deaf to your friends’ advice
[02:59.89]Because you know that your heart will never be full
[03:03.38]It doesn't always have to be beautiful
[03:08.54]Unless its beautiful
[03:12.10]Baby I know it's over
[03:15.55]Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
[03:19.08]Now we know it’s true
[03:22.71]The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you
[03:26.57]Baby I know it's over
[03:30.18]Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
[03:34.09]Now we know it’s true
[03:37.51]The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you

[00:24.86]I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely,
[00:27.56]I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining,
[00:30.96]But life keeps on complicating, an' I'm debating,
[00:32.96]On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
[00:36.22]Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,
[00:38.08]But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,
[00:40.68]When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
[00:44.12]I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs,
[00:48.15]Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
[00:50.35]Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
[00:53.77]I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,
[00:57.60]I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
[01:01.59]I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
[01:04.38]I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,

[01:27.98]Marshall what happened at you, you can't stop with these pills,
[01:31.03]And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you.
[01:33.57]It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,
[01:36.50]Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
[01:39.63]Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
[01:42.03]They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
[01:44.67]Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
[01:46.99]He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
[01:49.93]But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,
[01:51.68]Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills.
[01:54.75]Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
[01:56.76]Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like ""yes man"",
[01:59.46]And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it,
[02:03.04]It's in their best interest to protect their investment.
[02:05.85]And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...
[02:07.95]
[02:09.46]I'm going through changes
[02:16.95]Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...
[02:24.07]
[02:24.49]My friends just can't understand this new me,
[02:26.45]That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,
[02:29.14]You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
[02:33.53]And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,
[02:36.52]I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,
[02:39.26]Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
[02:42.65]I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,
[02:46.58]Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
[02:49.35]And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright.
[02:52.79]And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,
[02:55.23]I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,
[02:57.98]I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
[03:00.78]Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, don't look now,
[03:03.50]Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
[03:06.66]Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,
[03:08.70]Yeah baby hold me down.
[03:10.06]
[03:10.69]I'm going through changes
[03:18.14]Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...
[03:25.31]
[03:26.28]Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through.
[03:29.77]Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.
[03:31.84]I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
[03:34.60]Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
[03:37.39]shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
[03:40.16]I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
[03:42.87]I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.
[03:45.76]Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
[03:48.52]I still love your mother, that'll never change,
[03:50.74]Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
[03:53.91]Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
[03:56.39]But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on anyday.
[03:59.72]There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
[04:02.53]Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain.
[04:05.30]But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,
[04:08.13]I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint.
[04:10.95]I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history,
[04:13.64]But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
[04:16.47]I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way.
[04:19.28]But I just had to get away, don't know why,
[04:20.35]I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..
[04:23.50]
[04:23.94]I'm going through changes

[00:07.32]The things we discovered inside
[00:11.12]
[00:14.12]Oh the crystal caves
[00:16.31]
[00:16.87]We shed both our jackets
[00:19.35]And I hammered brackets
[00:21.61]From old metal chairs
[00:23.44]To the walls, a crude set of stairs
[00:27.95]
[00:31.01]To lead us down
[00:33.07]
[00:33.32]And you tied a rope
[00:35.24]To the steepening slope
[00:37.96]A jerry rigged harness
[00:40.46]So we could descend in the dark
[00:44.41]
[00:47.09]But the tide came in
[00:49.40]
[00:49.84]And we found ourselves in the sea
[00:54.71]Deep under water
[00:56.78]We both found that we could still breathe
[01:01.04]So we spent the day submerged
[01:06.53]
[01:08.68]And we swam the evening away
[01:12.63]
[01:29.90]The water was clear
[01:31.71]Like the pure atmosphere
[01:34.59]As we kicked and fluttered
[01:36.64]Through caverns all cluttered with age
[01:40.52]
[01:43.49]In the afterglow
[01:45.61]
[01:46.29]We swim hand and hand
[01:48.17]Over white satin sand
[01:50.98]And you left a ribbon
[01:53.04]To honor the pale gibbon moon
[01:57.12]
[01:59.62]But that was years ago
[02:05.01]
[02:07.29]And we never came up for air
[02:12.05]Down there
[02:17.23]We can go anywhere
[02:20.73]
[02:23.98]The old world was dying
[02:26.11]While we took our flying
[02:28.48]Like peregrine falcons
[02:30.98]Beneath the transparent blue waves
[02:35.29]
[02:37.55]Far below the surf
[02:40.12]
[02:40.43]And we spent the hours
[02:42.61]With submarine flowers
[02:45.12]I knew I'd remember
[02:47.24]That day in November
[02:49.62]As we
[02:54.10]Felt alive again
[02:56.32]
[02:56.68]Cuz we found ourselves in the sea

[02:30.59]Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
[02:40.48]just nervous paces bracing for bad news

[04:09.77]Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
[04:13.16]and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
[04:15.97]I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
[04:18.86]I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
[04:22.27]You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
[04:25.39]And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
[04:28.28]I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim

[04:36.58]but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up,
[04:38.95]see I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too

[05:55.17]And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
[05:57.95]That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
[06:01.23]I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
[06:04.01]or maybe you just need to treat her better
[06:06.19]I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself,
[06:10.89]I think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
[06:15.75]why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
[06:19.45]I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

[06:27.71]and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
[06:30.74]and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

[01:53.67]Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
[01:56.61]My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
[01:59.82]I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
[02:02.88]Wavin' the gun around, I think I’m down to a hundred pounds
[02:05.91]There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
[02:08.90]The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
[02:12.24]I must be buggin' the f-ck out, but what the f-ck about?
[02:15.03]Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
[02:18.10]They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
[02:21.15]Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
[02:24.30]I pick it and open it but it’s stuffed full of human parts
[02:27.38]I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
[02:30.26]Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
[02:33.40]The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
[02:35.79]
[02:36.29]Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
[02:39.37]But I can hear my luck keep calling me (My music box)

[03:03.96]Neck like a pixie stick
[03:05.29]The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippins,
[03:08.51]I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
[03:11.26]Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'

[03:15.61]forced and treat em all
[03:17.00]stingy I've become
[03:19.19]Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
[03:22.10]Am I dreamin', is it real Someone pinch me on the buns
[03:25.15]The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
[03:28.04]I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
[03:31.79]then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
[03:34.40]with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
[03:37.32]But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
[03:40.50]Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
[03:43.81]I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
[03:46.76]So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
[03:49.76]Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
[03:52.77]Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
[03:55.89]Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
[03:58.79]Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela
[04:01.39]
[04:01.89]Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)

[00:33.22]
[00:39.15]Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
[00:43.34]
[00:44.47]About a brave young Indian you should remember well
[00:49.25]From the tribe of the Pima Indian
[00:52.43]A proud and peaceful band
[00:54.99]Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
[01:00.81]Down the ditches for a thousand years
[01:03.04]The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
[01:05.79]'Till the white man stole the water rights
[01:08.35]And the sparklin' water stopped
[01:11.59]Now Ira's folks were hungry
[01:13.98]And their land grew crops of weeds
[01:16.49]When war came, Ira volunteered
[01:19.39]And forgot the white man's greed

[01:28.37]Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
[01:30.93]Nor the Marine that went to war
[01:34.35]
[01:36.54]There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
[01:39.85]Two hundred and fifty men
[01:42.34]But only twenty-seven lived to fight back down again
[01:47.53]And when the fight was over
[01:50.26]And when Old Glory raised

[02:22.06]Ira returned a hero
[02:25.05]Celebrated through the land
[02:27.50]He was wined and speeched and honored;
[02:30.39]Everybody shook his hand
[02:32.63]But he was just a Pima Indian
[02:35.63]No water, no crops, no chance
[02:38.16]At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
[02:41.07]And when did the Indians dance
[02:43.00]

[03:00.42]
[03:00.99]Jail was often his home
[03:03.47]They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
[03:05.92]like you'd throw a dog a bone!
[03:09.32]
[03:11.01]He died drunk early one mornin'
[03:14.33]Alone in the land he fought to save
[03:16.83]Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
[03:19.02]Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[00:46.05]that I can handle unless I absolutely have to

[00:50.01]I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
[00:52.99]If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
[00:55.98]Now Ja said ""I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it""
[00:58.94]There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it

[02:20.95]And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
[02:23.86]But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
[02:26.85]The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
[02:29.99]It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
[02:32.82]We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
[02:35.68]Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
[02:38.56]And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
[02:41.62]Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him

[00:32.27]All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
[00:35.48]I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
[00:38.45]I dont why I trusted you but I knew that I could
[00:41.25]We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
[00:44.15]I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

[00:59.01]It seems, It seems
[01:01.50]That I can't shake those memories
[01:04.92]I wonder if you have the same dreams too.
[01:09.44]
[01:10.75]The littlest things that take me there
[01:13.82]I know it sounds lame but its so true
[01:16.97]I know its not right, but it seems unfair
[01:19.66]That the things are reminding me of you
[01:22.60]Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
[01:25.67]Even if for only one weekend
[01:28.50]So come on, Tell me
[01:30.85]Is this the end?
[01:33.48]
[01:33.88]Drinkin' tea in bed
[01:35.54]Watching DVD's
[01:36.99]When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
[01:39.83]You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
[01:42.86]As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
[01:45.77]the first time that you introduced me to your friends
[01:48.55]and you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand
[01:51.48]when I was feeling down, you made that face you do
[01:54.54]no one in the world that could replace you
[01:57.08]
[01:57.89]Dreams, Dreams

[02:00.60]You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him

[03:20.21]All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
[03:22.91]Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
