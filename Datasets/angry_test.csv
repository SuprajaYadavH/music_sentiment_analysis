[00:39.10]When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
[00:43.86]But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
[00:47.26]And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
[00:51.77]And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.
[00:55.88]
[00:56.20]Till I collapse Im spillin these
[00:57.59]raps long as you feel em

[01:15.60]Get the illin to stop, amoxacillins just not real enough
[01:19.40]The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana
[01:21.87]Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
[01:24.97]Your comin with me, feel it or not youre gonna fear it
[01:27.77]Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
[01:30.62]You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,
[01:32.32]Is it a miracle
[01:33.53]Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up?

[01:42.53]Till the lights go out
[01:43.91]Till my leg give out
[01:45.30]Cant shut my mouth
[01:46.66]Till the smoke clears out
[01:48.09]And my high burn out
[01:49.54]Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
[01:52.22]Till the roof comes off
[01:53.74]Till the lights go out

[01:59.38]Am I high, perhaps?
[02:00.72]Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
[02:03.10]
[02:03.65]Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin

[02:06.65]And you spit and people are feelin ya shit
[02:08.91]This is your moment and every single minute
[02:11.32]You spend trynna hold on to it
[02:12.95]cuz you may never get it again
[02:14.66]So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
[02:17.46]And when your run is over
[02:18.54]Just admit when its at its end
[02:20.32]Cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
[02:23.10]I got a list
[02:23.78]Heres the order of my list that its in 
[02:25.92]It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
[02:28.83]Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
[02:31.66]But in this industry, Im the cause of a lotta
[02:33.78]Envy
[02:34.13]So when Im not put on this list
[02:35.76]The shit does not offend me
[02:37.06]Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins
[02:39.61]Botherin me, even though half
[02:40.79]You people gotta fuckin problem with me
[02:42.89]You hate it but you know respect you got to
[02:44.74]Give me
[02:45.56]The press wet dream like
[02:46.44]Bobby and Whitney
[02:47.72]Nate hit me

[02:49.85]Till the lights go out
[02:51.29]Till my leg give out
[02:52.75]Cant shut my mouth
[02:53.99]Till the smoke clears out
[02:55.34]And my high burn out
[02:56.78]Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
[02:59.24]Till the roof comes off
[03:01.04]Till the lights go out

[03:10.77]Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's
[03:13.07]Heart, what is he thinkin', how
[03:14.82]Not to go against me, smart
[03:16.30]And it's absurd how people hang on every word
[03:18.91]I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
[03:21.85]But I'll never be served, my
[03:23.06]Spot is forever reserved
[03:24.70]If I ever leave Earth
[03:26.11]That would be the death of me first
[03:27.57]'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could
[03:30.25]Ever be worse that's why I'm
[03:31.72]Clever when I put together every verse
[03:33.24]My thoughts are sporadic, I act like
[03:35.52]I'm an addict
[03:36.24]I rap like I'm addicted to smack,
[03:37.86]Like I'm Kim Mathers
[03:39.09]But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
[03:41.79]The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
[03:44.62]So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'
[03:46.53]On them, the track is on some
[03:48.30]Battlin' rap who wants some static
[03:50.19]'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that
[03:51.91]I'm Slim matters
[03:53.01]A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so
[03:55.90]Till the roof comes off,
[03:57.00]Till the lights go out
[03:58.37]Till my leg give out
[03:59.74]Can't shut my mouth
[04:01.16]Till the smoke clears out
[04:02.55]And my high burn out
[04:03.95]I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[04:06.67]Till the roof comes off
[04:08.23]Till the lights go out
[04:09.61]Till my legs give out
[04:11.03]Can't shut my mouth
[04:12.34]Till the smoke clears out
[04:13.82]Am I high, perhaps?
[04:15.23]I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[04:17.79]
[04:18.09]Until the roof, (Until the roof)
[04:20.14]the roof comes off (The roof comes off)
[04:22.79]Until my legs, (Until my legs)
[04:25.60]give out from underneath me,
[04:29.53]I, I will not fall,
[04:34.12]I will stand tall
[04:36.78]Feels like no one can
[04:39.29]beat me

[02:57.24]and I don't need to go into any more details

[04:09.77]Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
[04:13.16]and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
[04:15.97]I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall

[04:22.27]You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
[04:25.39]And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
[04:28.28]I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim
[04:32.30]Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
[04:34.10]Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
[04:36.58]but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up,
[04:38.95]see I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
[04:43.35]Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
[04:46.09]Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
[04:49.04]
[05:01.60]My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
[05:05.21]got out of bed at all
[05:07.51]The morning rain clouds up my window..
[05:11.34]and I can't see at all
[05:13.57]And even if I could it'll all be grey,
[05:17.10]put your picture on my wall
[05:19.58]It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
[05:23.28]it's not so bad..
[05:24.88]Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
[05:28.03]You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
[05:30.94]Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
[05:33.75]and here's an autograph for your brother,
[05:35.53]I wrote it on the Starter cap
[05:37.16]I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
[05:40.42]Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
[05:43.26]But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
[05:46.31]I say that shit just clownin dogg,
[05:47.90]c'mon - how fucked up is you?
[05:49.33]You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
[05:52.00]to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
[05:55.17]And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
[05:57.95]That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
[06:01.23]I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
[06:04.01]or maybe you just need to treat her better
[06:06.19]I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself,
[06:10.89]I think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
[06:15.75]why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
[06:19.45]I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
[06:21.55]I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
[06:25.04]Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
[06:27.71]and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
[06:30.74]and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
[06:33.60]Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
[06:37.27]Damn!

[03:09.46]You've gone sketchin' too many times
[03:26.50]You've gone sketchin' too many times
[03:33.50]Why don't ya give it a rest

[04:22.50]But your flaps r' wearin' thin
[04:23.50]And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
[04:25.50]But this nightmare never ends
[04:27.50]Don't forget to call my lawyers
[04:28.50]With ridiculous demands
[04:30.50]An you can take the pity so far
[04:31.50]But it's more than I can stand
[04:33.50]'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
[04:35.50]Tell me how long has it been
[04:37.50]'Cause 5 years is forever
[04:38.50]An you haven't grown up yet
[04:40.50]You could be mine
[04:46.00]But you're way out of line
[04:52.50]With your bitch slap rappin'
[04:53.50]And your cocaine tongue
[04:55.50]You get nuthin' done
[04:59.00]I said you could be mine
