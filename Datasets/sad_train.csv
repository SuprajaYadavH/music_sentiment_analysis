[00:23.86]It was cold, but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
[00:31.64]Left my scarf there at your sister's house
[00:35.27]And you still got it in your drawer even now
[00:40.66]
[00:51.23]Oh your sweet disposition
[00:53.92]At my wide eye gaze
[00:56.97]We're singing in a car getting lost upstate
[01:02.19]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces in the place
[01:06.49]And I can picture it after all these days
[01:12.23]And I know it's long gone, and magics not here no more
[01:17.31]And I might be okay, but i'm not, found it all
[01:27.03]
[01:27.97]Cause here we are again on that little time street
[01:33.02]You almost ring the red cause you were looking over me
[01:37.44]Wind in my air I was there I remember it all too well
[01:46.48]
[01:48.06]Photo album on my counter
[01:50.78]Your cheeks were turning red
[01:53.14]You used to be a little kid with your glasses in a twin size bed
[01:58.37]And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tivo team
[02:03.60]You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
[02:08.64]
[02:09.11]And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
[02:13.87]And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed you
[02:23.78]
[02:24.75]Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
[02:29.64]We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[02:34.20]Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well
[02:44.29]
[03:00.03]And maybe we got lost in translation
[03:03.05]Maybe I asked for too much
[03:05.21]But maybe this thing wasn't masterpiece
[03:08.09]He tored it all up
[03:10.37]Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well
[03:20.32]
[03:20.80]Hey you called me up again just to break me like a promise
[03:26.04]So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[03:31.40]I'mma crumble up piece of paper lying here
[03:35.29]Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
[03:45.40]
[03:54.96]Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[03:59.95]I like to be my old self again
[04:02.25]But i'm still trying to find it
[04:04.99]After platshirt days and that's when you made me your own
[04:09.72]Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
[04:15.29]But your keep my old scarf from that very first week
[04:20.06]Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
[04:25.21]You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well
[04:35.30]
[04:36.20]Cause there we are again and I loved you so
[04:40.76]Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
[04:46.19]It was where, I was there, I remember it all too well
[04:55.69]
[04:56.32]Wind in my air, you were there, you remember it all
[05:01.26]Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
[05:06.39]It was where, I was there I remember it all too well

[00:31.64]Lit through the darkness at 1:58
[00:36.08]The words that you whispered
[00:38.52]For just us to know
[00:40.66]You told me you loved me
[00:43.03]So why did you go, away?
[00:47.25]
[00:53.00]Away?
[00:56.43]
[01:12.23]I do recall now the smell of the rain
[01:17.08]Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane
[01:21.34]That July 9th the beat of your heart
[01:25.85]It jumps through your shirt
[01:27.87]I can still feel your arms
[01:30.27]But now I'll go sit on the floor
[01:34.59]Wearing your clothes
[01:37.38]All that I know is that
[01:39.50]I don't know how to be something you miss
[01:45.40]
[01:46.60]Never thought we'd have a last kiss
[01:55.40]Never imagined we'd end like this
[02:06.67]Your name, forever the name on my lips
[02:12.93]
[02:15.81]I do remember the swing in your step
[02:20.34]The life of the party, you're showing off again
[02:24.36]And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in
[02:29.19]I'm not much for dancing but for you I did
[02:33.36]Because I love your handshake
[02:36.38]Me and my father
[02:38.52]I love how you walk with
[02:40.94]your hands in your pockets
[02:42.85]How you kissed me when I was
[02:45.00]In the middle of saying something
[02:47.40]There's not a day when I don't miss those rude interruptions
[02:52.12]But now I'll go sit on the floor
[02:56.22]Wearing your clothes
[02:58.93]All that I know is that
[03:01.03]I don't know how to be something you miss

[03:28.24]Your name, forever the name on my lips
[03:35.95]Mmmmm mmm mmm
[03:40.12]
[03:46.92]So I'll watch you live in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
[03:56.44]And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
[04:05.40]And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
[04:16.12]Hope it's nice where you are
[04:19.29]
[04:22.40]And I hope the sun shines
[04:24.74]And it's a beautiful day
[04:27.05]And something reminds you
[04:29.48]You wish you had stayed
[04:31.56]You can plan for a change in weather and town
[04:36.05]But I never planned on you changing your mind
[04:40.59]
[04:44.11]So.. I'll go sit on the floor
[04:49.35]Wearing your clothes
[04:52.21]All that I know is that
[04:54.28]I don't know how to be something you miss
